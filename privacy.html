          <p>
            A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and

            by the browser. <br />The identifier is then sent back to the server
            each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies may

            date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of
            the user session, when the web browser is closed. <br />Cookies do
            not typically contain any information that personally identifies a
